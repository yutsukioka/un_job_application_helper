    Use inputs/application_context.md and any relevant analysis outputs to generate a complete CV (résumé).
    Include:
    1. Header with placeholders for name and contact if missing.
    2. A summary statement based on the UVP or derived from candidate evidence and JD alignment.
    3. Experience section: reverse‑chronological roles, with 2–4 bullet points per role. Use strong verbs, quantifiable outcomes (placeholders if needed) and integrate high‑priority keywords naturally. Use enhanced bullets when available.
    4. Education section listing degrees, institutions and graduation years (use placeholders if missing).
    5. Skills/Certifications section listing relevant skills, languages, tools and certifications from the candidate’s inputs and the skills taxonomy.
    Maintain a factual, concise tone; do not invent details. Output in plain text with clear section headings.
