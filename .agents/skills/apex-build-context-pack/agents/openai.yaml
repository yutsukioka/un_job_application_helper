  default_prompt: |
    Create or update inputs/application_context.md for the Apex workflow.
    Use only content I provide (pasted below or referenced files in this repo).
    Preserve text verbatim inside fenced code blocks.
    If any section is missing, keep a placeholder like [PASTE HERE] rather than inventing.
    Ensure LIMITS includes CHAR_LIMIT, TARGET_LOW, TARGET_HIGH, WORD_TARGET (or placeholders).
    After writing the file, output a short checklist of which sections are present/missing.
