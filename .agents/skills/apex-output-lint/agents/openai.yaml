  short_description: "Final compliance pass: single spaces, ASCII punctuation, no bullets/tabs, correct newline separation."
  default_prompt: |
    Validate and fix formatting of the text below to meet strict e-recruitment field constraints:
    - Single spaces; ASCII punctuation only; no fancy ellipsis (use "...")
    - No bullets/tabs or accidental numbering
    - One paragraph per item (if multiple items, preserve exactly one newline between items)
    Do not invent facts; only minimal formatting fixes and placeholders if strictly necessary.
    If character limits apply, use the capel-fit skill/scripts for deterministic counting.
