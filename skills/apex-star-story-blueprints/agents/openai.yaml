  default_prompt: |
    Using inputs/application_context.md, create 3–4 STAR story blueprints.
    For each blueprint include:
    - Targeted requirement (with star weight if known).
    - Relevant experience selected (role/source).
    - STAR breakdown: Situation, Task, Action, Result.
    - Tailoring note: how to align the narrative tone with the organization’s mission or context.
    Select requirements that are emphasized in the JD or highly starred. Only use experiences from the user’s history; use placeholders for missing metrics or outcomes. Do not draft the cover letter here.
