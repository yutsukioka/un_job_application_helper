    Generate an Admin Profile from inputs/application_context.md.
    Output:
    1. A one-line headline summarizing the candidate’s professional focus and alignment with the role.
    2. One paragraph per job in the format "Job Title: duties and achievements", with exactly one newline between jobs.
    Use insights from keyword insertion mapping and bullet enhancements to write concise, results-oriented paragraphs. Use placeholders for missing metrics or specifics. Apply CAPEL character control for each paragraph, aiming for TARGET_LOW–TARGET_HIGH characters (with spaces) and never exceeding CHAR_LIMIT. Use single spaces and ASCII punctuation only. Do not include employer names, dates or headings.
