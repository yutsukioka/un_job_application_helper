    Using inputs/application_context.md, produce 5–10 critical phrases that should appear in the Admin Profile.
    For each phrase include:
    - Phrase: exact wording.
    - Why: why this phrase is important (based on JD or star rating).
    - Where to place: which job entry and where within the paragraph.
